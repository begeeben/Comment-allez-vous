Comment-allez-vous
==================

Comment-allez-vaou is an experimental XMPP/jabber multi-player poker game. It's completed at the 2012 Yahoo Open Hack Day in Taiwan. The reason for using XMPP connection is that 
I had no idea of websocket when writing this game. Still this game provides a demonstration of how XMPP can help building 
realtime multi-player game. To play it 3 jabber accounts are required, one as bot and the others as players. Despite of 
the nice looking graphics, from a player's point of view the login part of this game is tedious. 

This game uses strophe.js for XMPP stanza handling. The code hasn't been reviewed.
